Goals
-----
I had a few goals with the site redesign:
- Update the site to be more mobile friendly.
- Simplify the file structure when compared with the kludgy PHP based previous site.
- Maintain the family-friendly, non-corporate, "think local" identity & branding of Dr. Steiner's practice.

Plus some personal goals:
- Famliarize myself with Twitter's Bootstrap & Less
- Use git & github for development & deployment.

Implementation
--------------

- Took advantage of Bootstrap's "responsive" design to to handle visual presentation for mobile browsers.
- Single page formatting since the site isn't particularly large. No need for complex templating or backend.
- Emphasized contact information (phone number & address) at the top of the page to help mobile users.
