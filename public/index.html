                  <p>I enjoy all aspects of family dentistry, especially the children that will grow up with us in my long established practice.</p>
                  <p>Our office&mdash;<a href="#building">a renovated 1941 home</a>&mdash; is located just north of downtown Chandler in the historic Silk Stocking neighborhood. We are <strong>not located in a strip mall</strong>&mdash;the building retains the appearance of the original 1941 home. Inside, however, it's a completely modern and efficient <strong>state of the art dental facility.</strong></p>
                  <p>We use many new technologies, including <strong>intra-oral cameras</strong>, state of the art tooth colored restorative techniques, and DIAGNOdent&reg;&mdash;<strong>a completely non-invasive</strong> cavity detecting device. We also use digital x-ray technology that <strong>cuts radiation exposure by 90%.</strong></p>
                  <p>We are not a dental clinic&mdash;my staff and I pride ourselves on <strong>knowing our patients</strong> as people, not a number. We have patients ranging in age from 3 to 93, many of whom are from from the early days of this practice, which is increasingly unique in the growing Chandler area.</p>
                  <p>We will always happily accept new patients, and it is my goal to continue to provide <strong>personalized, quality, family dentistry</strong> in Chandler for another twenty years.</p>

              <p>In 1941, Mr. Edward Lambson, owner of the <a href="http://downtownchandler.org/arrow-pharmacy/">Arrow Pharmacy</a>, and his wife, Gladys, purchased the lot at 299 N. Arizona Avenue from Dr. A.J. Chandler:</p>
              <blockquote> 
                <p>Chandler and the entire United States were, at this time (1933), struggling to survive the aftermath of the 1929 Stock Market crash that stunned the entire world and from which the U.S.A. and Chandler never recovered until preparation for World War II began. Chandler, therefore, remained relatively static for the next ten years. A few businesses changed hands. Very few houses were built in town. In the area around town a few more farms and ranches were established and homes built.</p> 
                <p>To start a little activity in town Dr. Chandler offered to sell a block of building lots on Arizona Avenue for <a href="http://data.bls.gov/cgi-bin/cpicalc.pl?cost1=1&year1=1933&year2=2013">$1.00</a> if the new owner would build a home on it within 6 months. All of the lots sold and within the year new homes dotted the entire block. Gladys and I chose the south east corner lot at the intersection of Arizona Ave. and Detroit Street. On a recent visit to Chandler we noticed it was the only building to survive the recent business building boom in there. We sold the home to Jack Neely when we left Chandler in 1951. Jack sold it to a husband and wife team of physicians, Dr. Joseph Blech and Dr. Grace Busch.</p><small class="author">Mr. Edward Lambson, original owner of 299 N Arizona Avenue</small>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Drs. Blech and Busch resided in the house with their family for a few months while their new home on Erie St. was being built. In June 1962 they converted the residence to a medical office and medicine was practiced here for 28 years. Dr. Blech died in Febraury 1983. Dr. Busch continued practicing here until her retirement in May 1990.</p>
              <p>In August 1990 Dr. Dale Steiner purchased the building and remodeled it for use as a dental office. Renovation began in November 1990. The building was entirely gutted and 300 square feet were added. All new landscaping, roof, plumbing, electrical, stucco, etc. were part of the project. Only the original frame structure remained. Ending over 7 years of dental practice on Ray Road, in Chandler, Dr. Steiner began seeing patients in this building on April 23, 1991.</p>
